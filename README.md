<h3>Hello there! I am Janrie a website manager that motivated to combine the art of design with the art of programming.</h3>

My desire to start learning website development started when I was in senior high school. I discovered that I have skills in developing and designing websites. My web development journey began when I learned to code in HTML and CSS for the first time. At that time, these two markup languages were everything to me, and I'm happy to have them. It's just that I can only make a static website with a simple design that can't interact with users. After spending time practicing on my own, I decided to look for a program that would help me improve my skills in website development.
